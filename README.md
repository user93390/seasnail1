## Story line
Originally snail++ was going to be called 'snailhack.' But to me it sounded too much like 'salhack' (another Minecraft client).

Snail++ used to be developed by two people, Chronosuser and Seasnail1. Later on, Chronosuser would abandon the project and work on his own client. When I first started developing snail++, I wanted to make the client private because I was really bad at coding at the time. After some time, Chronosuser thought it would be a good idea to give someone the non-obfuscated client; it turns out it was a bad idea (because he later cracked the client later on).
Ironically, I was thinking about making the client open source because I didn't like how long it took to add someone's HWID (MAC address). 
When Chronosuser abandoned the project, I felt really demotivated to do anything because I could not rely on anyone to do anything.(This is around-ish the time when I started to look for developers.) 

Roughly early summer, I regained motivation. I started to make really good progress in addon's performance (7-14 commits a week), so much so that people were thinking I was skidding from blackout. (They were so sure of it they didn't even want to look in the source code.) 

Around atum, I was not as consistent in updates (because of school and other things), but still I tried to get at least 1 commit every other day. I also was learning how to be more consistent in my coding logic. 

In early winter of 2024, I was more consistent in commits and overall client performance, nothing much.
As of 2025-01-12, Snail++ will not be archived anytime soon, and it will still be a passion project.
